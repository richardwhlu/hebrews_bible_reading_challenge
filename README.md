## What's the Challenge?

We will be starting a Bible study through the book of Hebrews in the Fall! There are a lot of Old Testament themes throughout the book, so having a fresh reminder will help us better understand and apply the Scriptures properly into our lives. To aid in this effort, we will have a friendly challenge to read through the first five books of the Bible! Never heard of the Pentateuch? No worries. Need to touch up on your Torah? This is the right place. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy are about 125,000 words in all, so at the average reader's speed (200 words per minute), it should only take about 10.5 hours to read through!

## Ok, but What's the Prize?

If you are able to read through Deuteronomy by the start of our study (Sept. 14), you will be rewarded with a free meal of your choice (likely delivered through DoorDash). Food for thought.
